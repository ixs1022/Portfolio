			As we grow up, we only hope we will figure out who and what we want to be. As we get older, we realize it's not that easy.

			I am a third-year Web and Mobile Computing student at RIT. I spent my childhood dreaming of being an astronaut and a teacher and a doctor. I have always wanted to explore the world, meet new people, and understand more than I can even imagine is possible. But I never imagined I would end up in computing.

			I have spent my three years at college working through this unimaginable reality, and finally came to the conclusion it wasn't so unimaginable. I love to learn - there's nothing better and certainly nothing wrong with learning new things. On top of that, computing is limitless. I could be a part of anything and everything I love by pursuing a degree in technology.

			If you were to ask my friends and family to list some of my favorite things, their top answers would probably be sharks, socks and cupcakes. Sharks are my favorite animals - one day I want to cage dive and hopefully see a shark in real life. I recently had to upgrade my socks to a larger drawer, and I still feel like I'm running out of options even after my dad got my a baker's week of shark socks. And cupcakes are DEFINITELY my favorite - I love to bake them and eat them.

			But that's not all. I enjoy playing soccer, doing yoga, and cross country skiing. When I am bored or am tired of doing the same ol' thing, I like to pull out my knitting needles or start (and finish) a new crafting project.

			My special talents include watching Netflix and eating cupcakes. And I am number one at being a cauntie (cat auntie) - her name is Shadow and she is great.
