		<p>I’m back! I know, it has been a little while since I’ve written anything. Between the PMS’ing weather and my own ‘laziness’, the last two weeks have been mostly uneventful. But, there are couple of things I decided to combine so I could use this title (Fine Whining & Dining).</p><br/><br/>

		<p>Last Wednesday (March 1), RIT in Rochester had their career fair. An event of around 250 
			companies and thousands of students looking for co-ops and full-time jobs. Well, here at 
			RIT Croatia in Dubrovnik, we had our own variation of that. They call it Career Education 
			Day (CED). Unlike the event in Rochester, CED is mandatory because there are no classes; and 
			DEFINITELY unlike the event in Rochester, there are only about 25 companies and a couple 
			hundred students at CED.</p><br/>
		<p>Here’s how it goes: wake up early, get dressed (business official), and arrive at the venue 
			(Rixos Libertas – it’s a beautiful hotel) for the opening ceremony and the first panel. Then, 
			throughout the day each student goes to three presentations that you either signed up for or 
			were placed in by the school. It is advertised as a good way to network and find a co-op or 
			full-time job. They set that up nicely, too, because in the middle of the day, there is a 
			speed networking event to connect with employers.</p><br/>
		<p>Can you guess how I came up with the title yet? Just in case there’s any confusion. The days 
			leading up to this (actually the week or two), we Americans didn’t really want to attend. 
			Although I am use to the early mornings, I am pretty much the only one. Moreover, there was 
			this idea that this won’t really benefit us. To an extend, I agreed. But for me, what really 
			bothered me, is that usually on Wednesday I would only have one class and be done by 10, but 
			this event was spread across the whole day.</p><br/>
		<p>BUT, I am a positive enough person. Whether I expressed it aloud or not, I believed this could 
			still be interesting. I wasn’t really sure what the presentations would be like, but I thought 
			that maybe they could be cool or informative. Well, I was half right!</p><br/>
		<p>The first panel in the morning was a little boring for me. It wasn’t very relevant to me 
			personally. From what I remember, it was mostly about hospitality. But, there was a second 
			panel that was more about technology and about technology in hospitality. I 
			enjoyed that one more.</p><br/>
		<p>As for the presentations I attended, well, they started out promising. The first one was given 
			by a company called Enum. It is a small start-up company founded by a few the RIT Croatia students/alums. 
			The guy that gave the presentation is actually now a professor and the TA for one of my classes. 
			He talked about their small company and it was just amazing to hear about the company and how it started because it all 
			began at RIT Croatia.</p><br/>
		<p>After that, I had hope for the ones to follow. The second one, I was placed into (even though I 
			signed up for a different one) and it was about hospitality. It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t exactly 
			of interest either. And the third one- the third one was… interesting. When I first got there and 
			saw the screen, I thought it had great potential. The PowerPoint said it was going to be about AI, but 
			if you asked me what it was about at the end, I would tell you I have no idea. It was presented in a video game, but 
			the content didn’t stick. It was unorganized and sounded like nothing more than an advertisement for 
			Unity (a good software program for video game development- I’ve never used it so I don’t know much 
			else about it).</p><br/>
		<p>Overall, it wasn’t a bad experience, and maybe it wasn’t beneficial for us. But, maybe, it could 
			have been. I mean, hospitality is an international field. And technology- it’s everywhere. I don’t 
			know about anyone else, but it would be really cool to work abroad and it’s something I will be 
			considering in the next couple years. The worst part of the day was that it was cold and rainy, 
			but we survived so I’ll stop whining.</p><br/><br/>

		<p>At this point, you’re probably like, “Uh, okay Bella, I just read like an entire novel and you have 
			only been whining?” 
		That’s because I don’t think my fine dining is a story any larger than a children’s book.</p><br/>
		<p>Yesterday (March 8) was more than International Woman’s Day. It was also the Dean’s List Reception. 
			Yep, Rochester, RIT Croatia has a dinner with the Dean for students who have made Dean’s list in 
			the previous semester. And this was not some event set up in the Gordon Field House. It was held 
			at the Rixos Libertas Hotel. The venue was beautiful, and I was probably underdressed but I only 
			have so many outfits here in Dubrovnik.</p><br/>
		<p>There were four of us from Rochester that made the Dean’s List, but three of us attended the dinner 
			because the fourth student already left for Spring Break. There was a brief introduction from the 
			Dean at the beginning of the dinner, then we were invited to the buffet to get food. There was a 
			lot to choose from and I tried a good portion of different items, but I have to say I was most 
			excited for the quinoa salad because I have been looking for quinoa since I arrived in Dubrovnik.</p><br/>
		<p>Oh, and of course I was VERY excited for dessert *insert heart-eye emoji*. I tried nearly every 
			dessert that was there. I mean, jeez, can’t beat it - free wine, free dinner, AND free dessert. 
			I don’t think there is a need for more words. That sums it up!</p><br/><br/>

		<p>Up next is Spring Break. After a lot of stress about the plans, planes, and passport, my dad got it 
			all figured out and will be spending a week with me and we will travel to Rome and Venice. I cannot wait!</p><br/><br/>

		<p>Oh and a little aside: I added a few extra pictures. One is a picture of one the cats 
			I see in Pile at the bus stop a lot and have now befriended. One is a picture of dog 
			walking around as freely as we do. And the third is a picture of a cat chillin' on top 
			a car. These are just a few things I captured this week that are part of what I love 
			about Dubrovnik - puts a smile on my face.</p><br/>
